# Task-3-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
# ML_Task03 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand patterns, distributions, correlations, and feature behavior in a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
Netflix Movies and TV Shows (`netflix_titles.csv`)

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected dataset.
2. Plotted distributions of numerical features.
3. Analyzed categorical variables using count plots.
4. Identified outliers using box plots.
5. Examined feature relationships using correlation heatmap.
6. Wrote insights for each visualization.
7. Identified important features for prediction.

## Files Included
- `Task3_EDA_Netflix.ipynb` – EDA notebook
- `netflix_titles.csv` – Dataset
- `report.md` – Visual insights report

## Outcome
This task improved understanding of data patterns, relationships, and feature importance using visualization techniques.
